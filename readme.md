## Introduction

In this lab we will improve upon the analysis of the stumbleupon dataset, performing feature selection and feature engineering.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- K-best feature selection
- Feature selection through regularization
- Recursive feature elimination
- Use what we learnt in Feature Engineering to construct new features
- Compare Logistic Regression model performance based on different set of features picked above

**Bonus:**

- Plot the Logistic Regression coefficients

#### Starter code
